# Layrry Example

Layrry is an API for assembling modularized applications developed by Gunnar Morning. You can be found more details in [project repository](https://github.com/moditect/layrry). 

This repository contains an example that shows you how to use multiple versions of one module to be used within an application at the same time. This example also can give you an idea of how to overcome the split packages problem.
